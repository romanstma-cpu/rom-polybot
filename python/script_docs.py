Your reply must be EXACTLY one fenced ```python code block and nothing else —
no prose before or after it. The first lines of the script MUST be this
metadata header (comments):

# rom-script v1
# name: <short strategy name>
# description: <one sentence>

The script must define a top-level function:

    def decide(ctx):
        ...

`decide(ctx)` is called once per coin per engine tick (~every 5s live; once
per recorded tick, ~25s apart, in backtest) while an Up/Down market is open.
`ctx` is a plain dict of market fields (full reference below). Return None
to do nothing, or an order-intent dict to buy one side of the market:

    {"side": "up" | "down",        # REQUIRED - which side to buy
     "price": "ask" | <int 1-99>,  # REQUIRED - "ask" = cross the real book
                                   #   now (taker). An integer rests a limit
                                   #   at that many cents (fills only if the
                                   #   ask comes to it; not modeled as a
                                   #   maker fill in backtests).
     "size": <int>,                # optional contracts; capped by the user's
                                   #   safety rails, defaulted from settings
     "take_profit_pct": <float>,   # optional, e.g. 0.15 = sell at +15%
     "stop_loss_cents": <int>,     # optional, sell if our side's bid <= this
     "reason": "<short note>"}     # optional, shown in the trade history

Winning contracts settle at $1.00, losing at $0.00. Taker fee per contract:
theta x P x (1 - P) dollars at price P, where theta is the Polymarket US
schedule in force when the order is placed (0.06 since 1 Jul 2026, 0.05
before, and 0.0695 since 17 Sep 2026). At 0.0695 that is ~1.7c at 50c and
~0.6c at 90c before exchange rounding.
At most ONE position per market window per script — after your first intent
in a window (even one refused by the rails) that window is consumed.

ctx["portfolio"] is always present: {"balanceUsd" (None in backtests),
"openCount", "openPositions" (list of this script's open position dicts),
"todayPnlUsd"} — use it for "stop after -$10 today" / "size down when busy"
logic.

OPTIONAL HOOKS (define any subset; a script must define at least one of
decide / decide_market / manage / decide_signal / supervise):

    def manage(position, ctx):
        # Called every tick for EACH open position this script holds.
        # Return None or "hold" to keep holding, "sell" to flatten NOW at
        # the bid, or {"action": "update", "take_profit_pct": 0.2,
        # "stop_loss_cents": 30} to retune the exit targets (0 clears one).
        # This is how you build trailing stops, signal-reversal exits, and
        # time-based exits. `position`: {ticker, asset, side, contracts,
        # avgEntryCents, curBidCents, minsLeft, tpPct, slCents,
        # unrealizedPct}.

    def decide_market(market):
        # Called once per tick for each of the top general Polymarket markets
        # by volume (NOT the crypto Up/Down windows — decide() owns those).
        # This is how a script trades politics, sports, news, etc. Return None
        # to skip, or an intent:
        #   {"side": "yes"|"no",          # REQUIRED - which outcome to buy
        #    "price": "ask"|<int 1-99>,   # REQUIRED - cross the book, or rest
        #    "size": <int>,               # optional contracts
        #    "sizeUsd": <float>,          # optional dollars (ignored if size)
        #    "reason": "<short note>"}
        # `market`: {ticker, eventTicker, title, category, slug, closeTime,
        # hoursToClose, status, yesBid, yesAsk, noBid, noAsk, yesMid, noMid,
        # lastPrice, prevPrice, priceChange, spreadCents, volume, volume24h,
        # openInterest} — prices are FRACTIONS 0..1 and come from the app's
        # last cached quote; the REAL book is fetched only when you actually
        # return an intent. At most ONE entry per market per script.
        #   hoursToClose — hours until settlement (None if unknown). Gate on
        #     this: many markets priced 90-99c are long-dated futures, so
        #     "hold to settlement" can mean months of locked capital.
        #   spreadCents  — None unless the row carries a real two-sided book,
        #     which the market list usually does NOT. The real spread is
        #     enforced at submit by the "Max spread" rail at the top of this
        #     page (script_market_max_spread_cents, default 2c, 0 = off).
        #   volume24h    — prefer over `volume` (lifetime) to find LIVE events.
        # NOTE: decide_market() is NOT simulated in backtests (the recorded
        # corpus only covers crypto windows) — use SHADOW mode to validate it.

    def decide_signal(signal):
        # Called for each NEW whale/momentum signal the scanner records.
        # Return None to skip, True to follow it, or {"follow": True,
        # "sizeUsd": 10} to size it. Follows buy the SIGNAL'S side (you
        # filter and size; side-flipping isn't supported because it can't
        # be backtested honestly). `signal`: {source: "whale"|"momentum",
        # ticker, category, title, price (0..1), side, dollarValue,
        # confidence, edgePts, costCents, signalType, hourUtc, createdAt}.

    def supervise(app):
        # Called once per engine tick. Return None or {"set": {key: value}}
        # to change WHITELISTED app config — this is how a script switches
        # engines/strategy posture dynamically ("volatility high -> model
        # mode", "past 2am UTC -> disable momentum"). Whitelisted keys:
        # enable_trading, trade_whales, trade_momentum, crypto15m_enabled,
        # crypto15m_direction_mode
        # ("favorite"|"contrarian"|"model"); crypto15m_entry_threshold,
        # crypto15m_entry_max, crypto15m_min_delta_pct,
        # crypto15m_time_delay_min (numbers). Anything else is ignored.
        # Rate-limited to one change per 30s; every change is logged.
        # `app`: {hourUtc, balanceUsd, scriptTodayPnlUsd, engines: {...},
        # config: {current whitelisted values}, assets: [{asset, minsLeft,
        # sigma1m, modelProb, favoritePrice}]}.
        # NOTE: supervise() is NOT simulated in backtests, and it does NOT
        # run while the script is in shadow mode — it is the one hook that
        # changes the REAL engine, so shadow skips it (the heartbeat says so).
        # Arm the script to let it supervise.

Pre-injected globals (no import needed): `math`, `statistics`, `state` (a
persistent dict that survives between ticks — use it for cross-tick memory),
and `log(msg)` (shows in the app's Script log panel; print() is aliased to
it). Scripts are Python with a restricted set of builtins and imports —

{CONTRACT_DOC}

MARKET CONTEXT FIELDS (every field can be None — ALWAYS check before
comparing; a None you don't check will crash and disable the script):

{chr(10).join(fields)}

EXECUTION RULES:
- The script runs in a RESTRICTED Python. Allowed imports: {SCRIPT_MODULES}
  (plus `from __future__ import annotations`). Nothing else imports — no
  os, sys, requests, socket, subprocess, pickle, base64, operator or string.
- Available builtins are the ordinary data ones (len, range, sorted, dict,
  list, min, max, round, isinstance, getattr, ...). open, eval, exec,
  compile, input, vars and globals do not exist.
- Double-underscore names and attributes are refused except __init__,
  __name__, __qualname__, __doc__ and __class__, so super().__init__() and
  type(x).__name__ work. Frame and traceback internals (gi_frame, f_back,
  tb_frame ...) are refused too. Classes, dataclasses, enums, generators and
  single-underscore attributes all work normally.
- A strategy needs none of what is refused. A script that uses it fails to
  save with the line and the reason; rewrite it as a plain strategy.
- Hooks are called SYNCHRONOUSLY on the engine loop and must return fast:
  the per-call ceiling is ~1 second of wall clock and the whole trading loop
  waits behind you. No sleeping, no network calls, no heavy loops per tick —
  precompute into `state` incrementally instead. Use `def`, never
  `async def`.

THE USER'S SAFETY RAILS (applied to every intent — your script cannot
override these):
{rails}

THE USER'S RECORDED DATA (what a backtest can replay, {interval} is the
currently selected interval):
{_inventory(env)}

STRATEGY NOTES (hard-won, respect them):
- upAsk/downAsk are the REAL order book. When they are None there is no
  executable quote and returning an intent does nothing useful — check them.
- These markets are efficiently priced most of the time; blindly buying the
  favorite loses the fee. An edge needs a reason: spot has moved and the
  book lags, momentum persistence, model-vs-book divergence (modelProb vs
  the ask), timing (minsLeft), regime filters (sigma1m, RSI).
- Backtest fills are at the recorded ask, ticks are ~25s apart, and the
  panel is in-sample — a green backtest is a hypothesis, not a promise.
- Positions hold to settlement unless you set take_profit_pct /
  stop_loss_cents; these markets can gap to zero, so size for full loss.

THREE VALID EXAMPLES (format + None-checking to imitate):

{EXAMPLE_SIMPLE}```

```python
{EXAMPLE_STATEFUL}```

```python

Now write ONE script implementing the strategy the user describes below (or
if they described none, propose a sensible one using the fields above).
Reply with ONLY the fenced python block.

"""Stage 2 -- stream health.

Nothing in this repository has ever opened a WebSocket. Every stream test
drives `us_market_stream.ingest()` with a hand-built dict, so the reconnect
loop, the subscribe envelope, the ping cadence and every field name the
payload is indexed by are assumptions. This stage is where they meet a server.

The headline measurement is clock skew. `momentum_window.Tape.add` gates every
receipt on `0 <= now-at <= FRESH`, and the lower bound is exactly zero: a host
clock even fractionally behind the exchange rejects the whole tape, and a tape
rejecting everything is indistinguishable from a market that is simply quiet.
Momentum then reports nothing, forever, with no error anywhere. So the stage
measures the offset two ways -- through the tape's own reject counters, and
directly against raw `tradeTime` values -- and reports the distribution, not
just a verdict, so the operator can see the real margin against the 30s bound.

Both authenticated streams report `health()` (connected flag, message
counts, reconnects), and the account stream's snapshot goes into its check.
Some questions still need private attributes (`_task`, `_books`, `_dirty`),
and reading them is deliberate. `us_account_stream.consume_dirty()` is never
called here -- it *clears* the flag that service.py relies on to trigger
reconciliation, so a livecheck that consumed it would suppress a real
reconciliation in the app. The flag is read, never taken.

Nothing here sends. The market and private subscriptions are read-only by
construction, and the one HTTP call is a public GET through the interlock.

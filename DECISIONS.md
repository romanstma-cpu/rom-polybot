# Decisions

Assumptions made while working without confirmation. Each entry states the
ambiguity, the choice, and why it is the safest reasonable option.

## 2026-09-27 — leave out coins that clearly lose; size by the proven edge only on request

Once the gate qualifies a crypto strategy, one verdict covers every coin, so a
profitable coin can carry one that loses. Coins are now left out of live
entries when their own replayed record clearly loses: at least 20 trades, and
even the 95th percentile of a bootstrap of their profit per trade is below
zero. The asymmetry is deliberate. Dropping a coin can only reduce trading, and
the overall verdict is still computed on every coin, so leaving one out never
turns an unproven strategy into a proven one. Unproven is not the same as
losing: a coin with a thin or mixed record stays in.

Sizing gains a "proven edge" mode: a share (quarter by default) of the Kelly
stake computed from the verdict, with the loss rate at its 95% upper bound and
the replay's own average win and loss per contract. It is opt-in, not the
default, because it is the one change here that can make bets larger; with no
qualified verdict it bets nothing. Max loss per bet and the balance caps still
bound it.

## 2026-09-26 — the crypto engine trades live only on replayed evidence of a net edge

The main engine will not trade a signal group live until held-out settled
outcomes show a profit after costs. The crypto engine had no equivalent:
switched on, it placed real orders for whatever its settings said. Its default
buys favorites at 95-98c, where a strategy can win most windows and still
lose, because one miss costs what twenty to thirty wins earn.

Live crypto entries now wait until replaying the configured strategy over the
last 14 days of recorded windows (the Crypto tab's own backtest, one contract
per window, plus 1c slippage per fill) shows at least 50 trades over 5 days,
positive expected profit with the loss rate at its 95% upper bound, a positive
5th-percentile day-block bootstrap, and profit in both halves. The loss-rate
test is the one that matters for near-certain entries: 60 wins in 60 at 96c is
consistent with a 4% loss rate, which loses money, and a bootstrap cannot
resample losses that did not happen. The thresholds mirror the main engine's
(`signal_calibration.economic_check`: 40 trades, 7 days, bootstrap lower bound,
both halves) with the loss-rate bound added. They were chosen, not fitted:
there is no data in this repository to fit them to.

On by default, because the request was profitability and an unproven strategy
is not that. The recorder logs every window whether or not the engine trades,
so evidence builds without risk, and the Crypto page says why entries wait.
`crypto15m_require_proven_edge = false` restores the old behaviour. Parlay
schedules are exempt; their generator already chose each hour on held-out
windows.

Same change, two related choices:

- **Model tails.** The terminal-spot model used a normal curve. Minute-scale
  crypto returns are far heavier-tailed, and the model is used exactly where
  that matters: buying at 97-99.9c. It now uses a Student-t rescaled to the
  same variance, 5 degrees of freedom by default (excess kurtosis 6, inside
  the range usually measured for minute crypto returns). At equal variance the
  t is more peaked near the strike and doubts the far tail; the two cross near
  97%, the model-mode entry threshold, so every model entry sees the more
  cautious number. Three sigma out the normal curve says 99.87%, the t 99.41%.
  0 keeps the normal curve. The replay re-prices each recorded tick with the
  setting under test, so the backtest can compare them on the same windows.
- **Calibration guard against price.** The auto-pause compared recent
  high-confidence calls with a fixed 85% hit-rate floor. At 98.5c a call, 38
  of 40 passes that floor and loses money. The same calls are now also scored
  against what their side cost at the time (ask plus fee): pause when the
  one-sigma upper bound of the hit rate is below that break-even, resume when
  the hit rate itself clears it. With 40 recent windows this is a drift
  alarm, not proof in either direction; the evidence gate is the real check.

## 2026-09-11 — count crypto15m exposure in the group cap, but do not yet gate that engine

UPGRADE-5 is titled "account-wide risk controls" and opens by saying the
existing limits were per-engine. Its exposure query read `bot_positions`
alone. crypto15m keeps its own table and can already hold real money in a
series that a main-strategy entry is about to join, so the cap was measuring
one engine and calling it the account.

`GROUP_SQL` now unions `crypto15m_positions`. Those rows carry their own
`series` column, so they group natively; open exposure is `submitted`,
`filled` and `exiting`, excluding practice rows and resolved ones. Counting
them can only raise a group total, so an entry's remaining allowance shrinks
or stays equal — never grows.

The other half is deliberately not done here. `crypto15m_trader` and
`copy_trader` still never call `group_budget_usd`, so they can still open past
the cap; only the main strategy consults it. Wiring it in is not mechanical:
crypto15m sizes from `_bankroll_usd`, which is a different quantity from the
balance the main strategy measures fractions against, so someone has to decide
which bankroll a group fraction means before that engine can honour it.
Choosing silently would put a number on real orders that nobody had agreed on.
Counting the exposure is strictly an improvement on its own — the main engine
now sees the whole picture — and the remainder is recorded in TODO.md.

## 2026-09-11 — a touch without a ladder is not evidence of size

`_liquidate_position` sized an exit with
`affordable_at_depth(...) if bid_levels else remaining`. With no levels the
fallback was the entire remaining position, offered with nothing showing
behind the bid. UPGRADE-7 states exit size is bounded by displayed bid depth
and lists a test for holding when no bid depth exists, so the code contradicted
its own documented invariant.

Two readings were possible: an empty ladder means "depth unknown, proceed on
the touch", or it means "no depth evidence". Chose the second. The whole point
of upgrade 7 is that the exit never sells blind, and it already holds for a
failed quote, a missing bid and an out-of-range bid; a quote that reports a
touch with no ladder is the same class of missing evidence reached by another
door.

This is currently unreachable through the real adapter, because
`quote_from_book` returns `bid=None` when there are no bid rows and the earlier
guard catches it. It is fixed anyway: it is live against any quote source that
reports a touch without levels, and the old behaviour was one substitution away
from dumping a whole position into an unpriced book.

The trade-off is stated plainly: holding is now possible where an order would
previously have been placed, so a position can sit through a move that a blind
sale would have exited. That is the direction upgrade 7 chose deliberately —
the bad outcome it removes is selling a position still worth most of its cost
for almost nothing.

## 2026-09-10 — resolve the correlated-exposure series through the events table

`account_risk` grouped a prospective entry by `markets.series_ticker` first and
fell back to the event. That column is written from the market payload, and
every producer of that payload — `polymarket_api._normalize_market`,
`scanner`'s two market dicts — hardcodes an empty string, because the US
markets feed carries no series. The first branch of the COALESCE therefore
never fired, the group was always the event, and the cap bounded exactly what
`max_positions_per_event` already bounds. The tournament case the control
exists for was unimplemented.

The series does arrive, on the events feed: `fetch_events` reads `seriesSlug`
and `scanner` writes it to `events.series_ticker`. Two ways to reach it were
possible: populate `markets.series_ticker` by looking the event up at scan
time, or join `events` where the group is resolved. Chose the join.
Denormalising into `markets` would need a backfill for every market already
stored, would go stale whenever the events feed is ahead of the markets feed,
and would have meant editing `scanner`'s market dicts while other work is in
flight there. The join reads the same row the scanner already maintains.
`markets.series_ticker` is kept as the first branch so a populated column would
still win, which costs nothing and keeps the fix forward-compatible.

Both the aggregate (`GROUP_SQL`) and the single-entry lookup (`group_key`)
resolve the same chain — market series, then event series, then event, then
ticker — and both join on the position's own `event_ticker`, so an entry and
the exposure it is measured against always land in the same group. An
installation with no events rows, or with rows carrying no series, gets the
old behaviour byte for byte.

The change can only tighten. Merging two event groups into one series group
raises the exposure already counted against an entry, so the remaining
allowance shrinks or stays equal; it can never grow. `max_group_exposure_fraction`
stays at `0.0`, so nothing changes for anyone who has not opted in — this
repairs a control that was dead, it does not switch one on.

Replay had the same dead branch: `portfolio_replay` read `series_ticker` from
recorded market metadata, and `main_recorder` records only min_size, tick_size,
event_ticker, close_time and active. Two options again: start recording a
series, or resolve it at replay time. Recording was rejected. The series is not
in the market payload at all, so recording it would itself require an events
lookup at record time, and it would only apply to evidence gathered from now
on — every existing recording would keep grouping by event while live grouped
by series, which is precisely the live/replay disagreement that must not exist.
Replay now resolves through the same `events` table, via
`account_risk.event_series_map`.

Reading that table while replaying older evidence is not look-ahead. Series
membership is static: a market does not move between series and an event does
not change the series it belongs to, so the mapping is the same fact at replay
time that it was at record time. It says nothing about prices, fills or
settlements — nothing that was unknown at the recorded instant. The alternative,
grouping a backtest by event while live groups by series, would let a replay
report exposure live would have refused, which is the failure mode the caveat
in UPGRADE-5 promised against.

The lookup is skipped entirely while the fraction is zero, so the default
configuration never touches the database from a replay, and an unreadable or
absent events table degrades to no series rather than raising — the same
"no series available, group by event" path an empty installation takes.

## 2026-09-10 — price the live crypto fee from the dated US schedule

`crypto15m._fee_cents` hard-coded `FEE_RATE_CRYPTO = 0.07`, an international
rate, and it gates live crypto15m entries through the net-edge calculation.
`polymarket_api` passes `fee_schedule: None`, so the fallback was always the
operative value.

Left alone in 2.8 because the error is conservative — overstating cost makes
the engine demand more edge than it needs — and correcting it makes the engine
take *more* trades, which is risk-increasing. Now corrected on request: the
coefficient comes from `fees_us` at the schedule in force, so backtests and
live agree instead of differing by a penny per contract. An explicit
`schedule` rate still overrides, for what-if analysis.

Replayed ticks carry `observedAt` into the asset dict so a backtest charges
the schedule that applied then, not today's.

## 2026-09-10 — restate old script practice P&L rather than annotate it

Practice fills settled before the US fee correction used a per-category table
charging crypto 0.07 and geopolitics nothing. Two options: mark those rows so
the UI can show which schedule each used, or recompute them.

Chose recompute. The old figures are not merely stale, they are impossible —
no Polymarket US trade was ever charged those rates, and geopolitics was never
free. A practice record exists to answer "would this script have made money?",
and a mixed record answers it two different ways at once. Entry price,
contracts, outcome and placement time all survive on the row, so the correct
figure is fully reconstructible rather than estimated.

`db._restate_shadow_pnl_on_us_fees` runs once, guarded by a key in `app_kv`,
skips unresolved and never-settled rows, leaves already-correct rows alone,
and logs how many moved. It is a rewrite of recorded history, so it is
deliberately loud rather than silent.

## 2026-09-10 — assert e2e against `WorkspaceStatus`, not `TopBar`

`paper-activity.e2e.mjs` waited for a practice-mode string that exists only in
`TopBar.tsx`, a component nothing imports. Two readings were possible: the test
was right and `TopBar` should have been wired up, or the test was stale.

Chose stale-test. `WorkspaceStatus` is the component actually rendered, is
referenced by the layout, and carries the newer copy; `TopBar` still used
labels from an earlier design. Reviving dead UI to satisfy a test would change
shipped behaviour, which is the riskier of the two.

## 2026-09-10 — delete `TopBar.tsx` rather than leave it dormant

It could have been kept in case someone intended to restore it. Deleting is
reversible through git history, whereas leaving a second, subtly different
status component invites exactly the confusion that kept a test broken for four
releases.

## 2026-09-10 — keep `db.get_previous_snapshots_bulk` for now

The 2.11 momentum rewrite removed its only caller. It is a public-looking DB
helper, so it is queued in TODO.md for a deliberate check rather than removed
alongside an unrelated change.

## 2026-09-10 — kill switch lives on Dashboard only

Positions already has "Cancel All" for open orders. Flatten (sell everything)
is the more dangerous action, so it gets a prominent persistent banner on
Dashboard while any position is open. Keeping it off Positions avoids
duplicating a destructive control in a dense toolbar.

## 2026-09-10 — word-boundary fix for categorize short tokens

"inflation" was misclassified as sports (contains "nfl"), "something" as crypto
(contains "eth"). Short bare tokens (`nfl`, `eth`, `btc`, `sol`, `do`) now use
`\b...\b` regex matching while multi-word phrases keep substring match. This
preserves backward compatibility for "NFL Sunday" style phrases while fixing
false positives in everyday English.

## 2026-09-10 — keep ALTER loop + add columns to CREATE (schema drift)

The migration ALTER loop is the app's upgrade path and stays. But a fresh
DB executes SCHEMA first, and six columns referenced by INSERTs existed
only via ALTER. Added them to the CREATE statements as well — the coupling
is now explicit in SCHEMA, satisfying both fresh installs and the migrate
path (which still ALTERs for legacy DBs).

## 2026-09-10 — NaN guard in sanitize_rules

`float("NaN")` is valid Python but always-false in all comparisons (including
`> 0`). A NaN gate would silently disable every rule that references it. The
fix rejects NaN/Inf with `math.isfinite()` before float conversion.

## 2026-09-10 — OnboardingModal focus trap (pure React, no library)

No focus-trap npm package was added. The hook uses native
`querySelectorAll(FOCUSABLE)` and `keydown` handler to cycle Tab/Shift+Tab
within the modal, restore focus on unmount, and lock body scroll. Keeps the
dependency tree flat.

## 2026-09-10 — schema/insert column drift fix

`crypto15m_signals`/`crypto15m_ticks` INSERTs referenced an `interval`
column that existed only via the ALTER migration loop, not the base SCHEMA
CREATE. Same latent drift in `alerts.yes_sub_title`,
`bot_positions.script_id`, `crypto15m_positions.script_id/tp_pct/sl_cents`.
Production masked it (init_db runs SCHEMA then ALTERs, so the column got
added), but any code path building purely from SCHEMA crashed with
'no such column'. Fixed by adding the columns to the CREATE statements;
ALTER loop kept for legacy upgrade. Added TestInsertColumnParity, a
parser-level regression that asserts every static INSERT in db.py
references only base-SCHEMA columns — this whole bug class is now caught
at the source.

## 2026-09-10 — IPC config validation at the Electron boundary

`config:update`/`config:replace` forwarded renderer values to the store
unchecked. The backend validates deeply, but a compromised/buggy renderer
could send NaN/Inf (which survive JSON to Python and re-trigger the NaN
bug class), wrong-typed values, or arbitrary nested objects. Added
`electron/system/config-validate.ts`: a per-key type map (~180 keys) with
enum/array/nullable handling; unknown keys are dropped (forward-compatible)
rather than fatal. Wired into both IPC handlers; invalid payloads throw
before reaching the store. Decision: rules objects get shape-only checks
here (array of objects), deep validation stays in the Python backend — no
logic duplication.

## 2026-09-10 — integer-cents math in copy-trader sizing

`_compute_copy_contracts` used float floor-division (`budget // price`). At
clean penny prices this is off by one: `10.0 // 0.10 == 99.0`. The correct
notional is 100. Replaced with integer-cents math (`budget_cents //
price_cents`) so sizing is exact at every penny multiple. Same class of bug
as the exit-loss-budget discipline: never let float representation cost a
contract.

## 2026-09-10 — indicator/_floats uses math.isfinite, not f==f

`_floats` dropped NaN with `f == f` but kept Inf. An Inf close then poisoned
every downstream indicator (EMA seed, VWAP denominator, pct_change prev).
`math.isfinite(f)` rejects both. Also `ema_series` was computing `n` from the
raw list then seeding from filtered values — a filtered-empty series could
produce a bogus seed. Length now comes from the filtered list, so a
single-element period-1 EMA is the value itself (not `[]`) and insufficient
filtered data returns None. Test expectations updated to match.

## 2026-09-10 — clob_ws ignores out-of-range/malformed levels

`_best_from_levels` now skips prices outside (0,1) and non-dict price_change
entries. A single malformed book row could previously surface a best bid/ask
of 1.0 or garbage; the CLOB parser is a trust boundary from the exchange feed.

## 2026-09-10 — insert_bot_position does NOT write pnl_usd/resolved

The agent's copy-trader tests seeded rows via `insert_bot_position` assuming
it persisted `pnl_usd`/`resolved`; it writes neither (fixed column list).
Source is fine — the integration path always sets those via `update_*`.
Fixtures now set them explicitly via UPDATE, and the helper `_seed_pnl_copy`
wraps that. Decision: tests must match the real DB write contract, not the
assumed one.

## 2026-09-10 — new copy wallet baselines, not flagged eligible

`_filter_new_entries`: a wallet never followed before has its position added
to seen but is NOT returned as eligible — only wallets already tracked can
trigger new-entry alerts. The agent's test expected the opposite; the source
behavior prevents a flood when you start following a new wallet. Test
corrected to assert the real design.

## 2026-09-10 — config parity drift guard is the real concern; named keys are ghosts

The TODO item "Config parity: `signalDisplay`/`ledger` shape drift check" names
two keys that do not exist as config keys in any of the three config sources —
backend `DEFAULT_CONFIG` (python/config.py), the frontend `TraderConfig` type
(shared/types.ts), or the IPC validator `FIELD_TYPES` map
(electron/system/config-validate.ts). Grep across all three returned zero hits,
and the only "display"/"ledger" occurrences anywhere in the tree are prose (a
`require_entry_depth` comment and History/Scripts copy), not config keys.

Closing the item as stale: the drift-guard concern it is *trying* to describe is
already covered by the existing configparity test suite (backend→store coverage,
backend→type coverage, store-backlog-shrink-only test, validator covers every
included backend key, standalone validator test), which is wired into both
`config:update` and `config:replace` IPC handlers and runs and passes. There are
no `signalDisplay`/`ledger` keys to add and no drift to guard.

Deviation from a literal reading: a literal reading would add a test asserting
`signalDisplay` and `ledger` are present in all three sources — that test would
fail immediately because the keys are absent, and "fixing" it by inventing those
keys would be wrong. The safest reading is that the item described the real
goal (no silent drift between the three config sources) and used two example key
names that never landed; the existing suite achieves that goal.
